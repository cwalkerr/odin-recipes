        <h1>How to cook steak!</h1>

        <h2>Heres all you'll need:</h2>

        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Thick cut steak</strong> - no more than 2.5cm/1â€³ thick, because we want to cook this entirely on
                the stove
                (thicker cuts need to be finished in the oven).<br>

                <strong>Ideal steaks:</strong> boneless rib eye / scotch fillet, porterhouse
                / New York, T-bone. <br>

                <strong>Grade:</strong> takes high quality steak over the top amazing, really elevates economical steak.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Butter, garlic and fresh thyme</strong></li>
        </ul>
        </p>


        <div class="instructions">
            <h2>Instructions:</h2>

            <p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Bring to room temp!</strong> This makes an amazing difference to cooking through evenly
                    rather
                    than ending up
                    with a thick overcooked band in order for the very centre to be cooked to your liking;
                </li>

                <li><strong>Pat dry</strong> and season the steak generously with salt and pepper - this helps form that
                    amazing crust we all
                    know and love about great steaks;
                </li>
                <li>Get your skillet <strong>SMOKING HOT</strong> before putting the steak in - again, for the crust
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>WARNING</strong>: The butter will sputter when you add the thyme, so stand back!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take the steak off the stove <strong>BEFORE your desired internal temperature</strong> (see chart
                    below) because the
                    internal temperature will continue to rise as it rests; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>REST</strong> your steak for 5 to 10 minutes so it sucks its own juices back in and the
                    fibres relax. This is a must-do step for any protein you cook hard and fast!
                </li>

                </p>
